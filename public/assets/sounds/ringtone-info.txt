RINGTONE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
============================

This folder is for ringtone audio files. To add a custom ringtone:

1. Add an audio file named "ringtone.mp3" to this folder
2. The file should be in MP3 format for best browser compatibility
3. Recommended duration: 3-5 seconds (will loop automatically)
4. Recommended volume: moderate (the app will set volume to 50%)

If no ringtone.mp3 file is found, the app will automatically generate a ringtone using Web Audio API.
